Game Jam ! 

Make the character speak :)

This game is a (ultra) modest demo of our vectorial sprites feature, from our minimalist terminal-based-games engine, cluige. Our developer ambition is to import SVG files (at least paths inside them).

cluige is open-source : https://github.com/CreaJeu/cluige

This demo is only about images, sound is not yet possible in cluige !
